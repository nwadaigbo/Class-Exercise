<h1> MISSION </h1>
<p> The Visiola Foundation exists to support the emergence of a new cadre of African leaders by mentoring and training academically excellent youth in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Students pursuing careers in the STEM fields have better employment opportunities, as their skills are critically required to stimulate Africa’s growing industrial and manufacturing base. We aim to support an increasing number of ethical female entrepreneurial leaders with cutting-edge technical skills to lead Africa’s long-term socio-economic transformation.</p>

<h2>OUR PASSION</h2>
We are driven to achieve our mission, motivated by our understanding of the challenges facing many African countries, as well as the numerous opportunities to overcome these using knowledge derived from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
We believe in Africa’s long-term transformation through effective leadership by the continent’s highly educated next generation who will lead economically significant innovation.
